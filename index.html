                <p>Simple and lightweight &ndash; these are the main goals I had in mind when I started writing this time tracking tool. I wanted to create something that helps me keep track of what I'm doing all day without having to change much about my workflow. It turns out that this project is also a lot of fun and thus has become my private software development playground.</p>

            <h3>Features</h3>
            <p><a name="features"></a>Here is a quick overview of the features offered by WorkTracker:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>Single-Click-Interface</h4>
                    You can switch the project you are currently working on with a single click.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Local Data Storage</h4>
                    All data is stored in a local database. No data will be transmitted anywhere unless you explicitly tell the application to do it (in the future).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Comprehensive Time Log</h4>
                    WorkTracker does not just count your time, but creates actual log entries every time you switch between projects. This allows you to review your daily work in as much detail as you wish. (A full-featured log browser will be in the next release.)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Standalone Java Application</h4>
                    Runs on any platform that has a Java 8 runtime and does not need any installation procedure. You can in theory carry your application around on a USB stick and use it anywhere.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="right">
            <h3>Screenhots</h3>
            <p><a name="screenshots"></a>Here are some screenshots to convince you of the simplicity:</p>
